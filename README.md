This repository houses a miscellaneous collection of scripts crafted to simplify very random and repetitive tasks across different programs.  

I hope that these scripts, brewed from a teaspoon of efficiency and a big cup of laziness, help you work smarter and not harder.  

For most, they would have been quite helpful to have when I started my journey as a young bioinformatics padawan.

**Find a script:**  
programName_task.sh  

Feel free to use, modify and/or improve those scripts as you please. Let's be lazy together, but in a productive way!  

**Best fishes and Happy Coding!**
