This repository houses a miscellaneous collection of scripts crafted to simplify very random and repetitive tasks across different programs.  

I hope that these scripts, brewed from a teaspoon of efficiency and a big cup of laziness, will help bioinformatics padawan like myself in their exploration of the bioinfo space.

# Find a script  
programName_task.sh  
  
phyluce_MappingConfig.sh : make configuration file for mapping workflow in Phyluce v.1.7.* - interactive script, add chmod +x permission, execute script and follow prompt  

phyluce_PhasingConfig.sh : make configuration file for phasing workflow in Phyluce v.1.7.* - interactive script, add chmod +x permission, execute script and follow prompt  

phyluce_CorrectionConfig.sh : make configuration file for correction workflow in Phyluce v.1.7.* - interactive script, add chmod +x permission, execute script and follow prompt  
  
Feel free to use, modify and/or improve those scripts as you please. Let's be lazy together, but in a productive way!  

# Best fishes and Happy Coding!
